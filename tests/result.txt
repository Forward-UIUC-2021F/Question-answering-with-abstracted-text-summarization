1. What is natural language processing

Natural language processing is the science and engineering of computers understanding human language. It’s a broad field of study that includes linguistics, statistics, and machine learning. It’s the driving force behind machine intelligence in many modern real-world applications. Source: https://www. codementor.

2. Method of natural language processing

 In this article, we will cover the following techniques of NLP:
Tokenization Stemming Lemmatization Sentence Splitting Part of Speech Tagging Word Tagging
Tokenization: It is the process of breaking the text into tokens. A token is a single unit of text. For example, a sentence is a collection of words, a word is a collection of characters and a character is a collection of numbers. 
Tokenization is done by using white spaces, punctuation marks and sometimes by using special characters. 
Stemming: It is the process of reducing words to its root word. For example, the word "running" can be reduced to the root word "run". 
Lemmatization: It is the process of reducing words to its base form. For example, the word "running" can be reduced to the base form "run". 
Sentence Splitting: It is the process of splitting the sentence into multiple sentences. 
Part of Speech Tagging: It is the process of assigning a part of speech to each word in a sentence. 
Word Tagging: It is the process of assigning a word to each token. 
Applications of Natural Language Processing.  NLP has many applications in the real world.
