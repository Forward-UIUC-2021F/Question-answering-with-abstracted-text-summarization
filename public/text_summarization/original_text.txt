Data mining is looking for patterns in huge data stores. This process brings useful ways, and thus we can make conclusions about the data. This also generates new information about the data which we possess already. The methods include tracking patterns, classification, association, outlier detection, clustering, regression, and prediction. It is easy to recognize patterns, as there can be a sudden change in the data given. We have collected and categorized the data based on different sections to be analyzed with the categories. Clustering groups the data based on the similarities of the data.It is a process of extracting useful information or knowledge from a tremendous amount of data (or big data). The gap between data and intake has been reduced by using various data mining tools. It can also be referred to as Knowledge discovery from data or KDD.Start Your Free Data Science CourseHadoop, Data Science, Statistics & othersIt can be performed on various databases and information repositories like Relational databases, Data Warehouses, Transactional databases, data streams, and many more.There are many methods used for Data Mining, but the crucial step is to select the appropriate form from them according to the business or the problem statement.  These methods help in predicting the future and then making decisions accordingly. These also help in analyzing market trends and increasing company revenue.Let us understand every data mining method one by one.It is used to find a correlation between two or more items by identifying the hidden pattern in the data set and hence also called relation analysis. This method is used in market basket analysis to predict the behavior of the customer.Suppose, the marketing manager of a supermarket wants to determine which products are frequently purchased together.Buys (x,”beer”) -> buys(x, “chips”) [support = 1%, confidence = 50%]
Many similar examples like bread and butter or computer and software can be considered.There are two types of Association Rules:This data mining method is used to distinguish the items in the data sets into classes or groups. It helps to predict the behaviour of entities within the group accurately. It is a two-step process:For example, a banking company uses to identify loan applicants at low, medium or high credit risks. Similarly, a medical researcher analyzes cancer data to predict which medicine to prescribe to the patient.Clustering is almost similar to classification, but in this cluster are made depending on the similarities of data items. Different groups have dissimilar or unrelated objects. It is also called data segmentation as it partitions huge data sets into groups according to the similarities.A similar example of loan applicants can be considered here also. Some differences are depicted in the figure below.This method is used to predict the future based on the past and present trends or data set. Prediction is mostly used to combine other mining methods such as classification, pattern matching, trend analysis, and relation.For example, if the sales manager would like to predict the amount of revenue that each item would generate based on past sales data. It models a continuous-valued function that indicates missing numeric data values.Regression Analysis is the best choice to perform prediction. It can be used to set a relationship between independent variables and dependent variables.This method is used to identify patterns that frequently occur over a certain period of time.For example, a clothing company’s sales manager sees that sales of jackets seem to increase just before the winter season, or sales in bakery increase during Christmas or New Year’s eve.Let’s look at an example with a graph.A decision tree is a tree structure (as its name suggests), whereIn this decision, tree government classifies citizens below age 18 or above age 18. This would help them to decide whether a license must be issued to a particular city or not.This method identifies the data items that do not comply with the expected pattern or expected behaviour. These unexpected data items are considered as outliers or noise. They are helpful in many domains like credit card fraud detection, intrusion detection, fault detection etc. This is also called Outlier Mining.For example, let’s assume the graph below is plotted using some data sets in our database.So the best fit line is drawn. The points lying nearby the line show expected behaviour while the end far from the line is an Outlier.This would help to detect the anomalies and take possible actions accordingly.This method or model is based on biological neural networks. It is a collection of neurons like processing units with weighted connections between them. They are used to model the relationship between inputs and outputs. It is used for classification, regression analysis, data processing etc. This technique works on three pillars-This has been a guide to Data Mining Methods Here, we have discussed What Data Mining and different mining methods are with the example.

One of the aspects is Classification. Classification data mining techniques involve analyzing the various attributes associated with different types of data. Once organizations identify the main characteristics of these data types, organizations can categorize or classify related data. Doing so is critical for identifying, for example, personally identifiable information organizations may want to protect or redact from documents.
One of the aspects is Data cleaning and preparation. Data cleaning and preparation is a vital part of the data mining process. Raw data must be cleansed and formatted to be useful in different analytic methods. Data cleaning and preparation includes different elements of data modeling, transformation, data migration, ETL, ELT, data integration, and aggregation. It’s a necessary step for understanding the basic features and attributes of data to determine its best use. The business value of data cleaning and preparation is self-evident. Without this first step, data is either meaningless to an organization or unreliable due to its quality. Companies must be able to trust their data, the results of its analytics, and the action created from those results.These steps are also necessary for data quality and proper data governance. 
One of the aspects is Sequential patterns. This data mining technique focuses on uncovering a series of events that takes place in sequence. It’s particularly useful for data mining transactional data. For instance, this technique can reveal what items of clothing customers are more likely to buy after an initial purchase of say, a pair of shoes. Understanding sequential patterns can help organizations recommend additional items to customers to spur sales.
