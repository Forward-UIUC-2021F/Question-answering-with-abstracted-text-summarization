print(len("In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.[1][2][3] More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data,[4] i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data. Data structures are generally based on the ability of a computer to fetch and store data at any place in its memory, specified by a pointer—a bit string, representing a memory address, that can be itself stored in memory and manipulated by the program. Thus, the array and record data structures are based on computing the addresses of data items with arithmetic operations, while the linked data structures are based on storing addresses of data items within the structure itself.  A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.For example, we can store a list of items having the same data-type using the array data structure.This page contains detailed tutorials on different data structures (DS) with topic-wise problems.All Articles of Linked ListQuiz on Linked ListCoding Practice on Linked ListRecent Articles on Linked ListQuiz on StackAll Articles on StackCoding Practice on StackRecent Articles on StackQuiz on QueueAll Articles on QueueCoding Practice on QueueRecent Articles on QueueQuiz on Binary TreeQuiz on Binary Tree TraversalsAll articles on Binary TreeCoding Practice on Binary TreeRecent Articles on TreeQuiz on Binary Search TreesQuiz on Balanced Binary Search TreesAll Articles on Binary Search TreeCoding Practice on Binary Search TreeRecent Articles on BSTAll Articles on HeapQuiz on HeapCoding Practice on HeapRecent Articles on HeapQuiz on HashingAll Articles on HashingCoding Practice on HashingRecent Articles on HashingAll Articles on Graph Data StructureQuiz on GraphQuiz on Graph TraversalsQuiz on Graph Shortest PathsQuiz on Graph Minimum Spanning TreeCoding Practice on GraphRecent Articles on GraphAll Articles on TrieBinary Indexed Tree:All Articles on Binary Indexed TreeSuffix Array and Suffix Tree:All Articles on Suffix TreeAVL Tree:Recent Articles on Advanced Data Structures.All Articles on ArrayCoding Practice on ArrayQuiz on ArrayCoding Practice on ArrayRecent Articles on ArrayAll Articles on MatrixCoding Practice on MatrixRecent Articles on Matrix.1.

Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services. Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms. Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design. Data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both main memory and secondary memory.[8] Data Structures are used to store and manage data in an efficient and organised way for faster and easy access and modification of Data. Some of the basic data structures are Arrays, LinkedList, Stacks, Queues etc.This page will contain some of the complex and advanced Data Structures like Disjoint Sets, Self-Balancing Trees, Segment Trees, Tries etc.Suffix Array and Suffix Tree :‘Quiz’ on Balanced Binary Searched TreesIf you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to review-team@geeksforgeeks.org.
