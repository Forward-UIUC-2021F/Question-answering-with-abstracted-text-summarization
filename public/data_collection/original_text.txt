One of the aspects is Natural Language. Natural language refers to the way we, humans, communicate with each other.Namely, speech and text.We are surrounded by text.Think about how much text you see each day:The list is endless.Now think about speech.We may speak to each other, as a species, more than we write. It may even be easier to learn to speak than to write.Voice and text are how we communicate with each other.Given the importance of this type of data, we must have methods to understand and reason about natural language, just like we do for other types of data.Take my free 7-day email crash course now (with code).Click to sign-up and also get a free PDF Ebook version of the course.

One of the aspects is Challenge of Natural Language. Working with natural language data is not solved.It has been studied for half a century, and it is really hard.It is hard from the standpoint of the child, who must spend many years acquiring a language … it is hard for the adult language learner, it is hard for the scientist who attempts to model the relevant phenomena, and it is hard for the engineer who attempts to build systems that deal with natural language input or output. These tasks are so hard that Turing could rightly make fluent conversation in natural language the centerpiece of his test for intelligence.— Page 248, Mathematical Linguistics, 2010.Natural language is primarily hard because it is messy. There are few rules.And yet we can easily understand each other most of the time.Human language is highly ambiguous … It is also ever changing and evolving. People are great at producing language and understanding language, and are capable of expressing, perceiving, and interpreting very elaborate and nuanced meanings. At the same time, while we humans are great users of language, we are also very poor at formally understanding and describing the rules that govern language.— Page 1, Neural Network Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2017.
One of the aspects is From Linguistics to Natural Language Processing. Linguistics is the scientific study of language, including its grammar, semantics, and phonetics.Classical linguistics involved devising and evaluating rules of language. Great progress was made on formal methods for syntax and semantics, but for the most part, the interesting problems in natural language understanding resist clean mathematical formalisms.Broadly, a linguist is anyone who studies language, but perhaps more colloquially, a self-defining linguist may be more focused on being out in the field.Mathematics is the tool of science. Mathematicians working on natural language may refer to their study as mathematical linguistics, focusing exclusively on the use of discrete mathematical formalisms and theory for natural language (e.g. formal languages and automata theory).Computational linguistics is the modern study of linguistics using the tools of computer science. Yesterday’s linguistics may be today’s computational linguist as the use of computational tools and thinking has overtaken most fields of study.Computational linguistics is the study of computer systems for understanding and generating natural language. … One natural function for computational linguistics would be the testing of grammars proposed by theoretical linguists.— Pages 4-5, Computational Linguistics: An Introduction, 1986.Large data and fast computers mean that new and different things can be discovered from large datasets of text by writing and running software.In the 1990s, statistical methods and statistical machine learning began to and eventually replaced the classical top-down rule-based approaches to language, primarily because of their better results, speed, and robustness. The statistical approach to studying natural language now dominates the field; it may define the field.Data-Drive methods for natural language processing have now become so popular that they must be considered mainstream approaches to computational linguistics. … A strong contributing factor to this development is undoubtedly the increase amount of available electronically stored data to which these methods can be applied; another factor might be a certain disenchantment with approaches relying exclusively on hand-crafted rules, due to their observed brittleness.— Page 358, The Oxford Handbook of Computational Linguistics, 2005.The statistical approach to natural language is not limited to statistics per-se, but also to advanced inference methods like those used in applied machine learning.… understanding natural language require large amounts of knowledge about morphology, syntax, semantics and pragmatics as well as general knowledge about the world. Acquiring and encoding all of this knowledge is one of the fundamental impediments to developing effective and robust language systems. Like the statistical methods … machine learning methods off the promise of automatic the acquisition of this knowledge from annotated or unannotated language corpora.— Page 377, The Oxford Handbook of Computational Linguistics, 2005.Computational linguistics also became known by the name of natural language process, or NLP, to reflect the more engineer-based or empirical approach of the statistical methods.The statistical dominance of the field also often leads to NLP being described as Statistical Natural Language Processing, perhaps to distance it from the classical computational linguistics methods.I view computational linguistics as having both a scientific and an engineering side. The engineering side of computational linguistics, often called natural language processing (NLP), is largely concerned with building computational tools that do useful things with language, e.g., machine translation, summarization, question-answering, etc. Like any engineering discipline, natural language processing draws on a variety of different scientific disciplines.— How the statistical revolution changes (computational) linguistics, 2009.Linguistics is a large topic of study, and, although the statistical approach to NLP has shown great success in some areas, there is still room and great benefit from the classical top-down methods.Roughly speaking, statistical NLP associates probabilities with the alternatives encountered in the course of analyzing an utterance or a text and accepts the most probable outcome as the correct one. … Not surprisingly, words that name phenomena that are closely related in the world, or our perception of it, frequently occur close to one another so that crisp facts about the world are reflected in somewhat fuzzier facts about texts. There is much room for debate in this view.— Page xix, The Oxford Handbook of Computational Linguistics, 2005.
One of the aspects is Natural Language Processing. As machine learning practitioners interested in working with text data, we are concerned with the tools and methods from the field of Natural Language Processing.We have seen the path from linguistics to NLP in the previous section. Now, let’s take a look at how modern researchers and practitioners define what NLP is all about.In perhaps one of the more widely textbooks written by top researchers in the field, they refer to the subject as “linguistic science,” permitting discussion of both classical linguistics and modern statistical methods.The aim of a linguistic science is to be able to characterize and explain the multitude of linguistic observations circling around us, in conversations, writing, and other media. Part of that has to do with the cognitive size of how humans acquire, produce and understand language, part of it has to do with understanding the relationship between linguistic utterances and the world, and part of it has to do with understand the linguistic structures by which language communicates.— Page 3, Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing, 1999.They go on to focus on inference through the use of statistical methods in natural language processing.Statistical NLP aims to do statistical inference for the field of natural language. Statistical inference in general consists of taking some data (generated in accordance with some unknown probability distribution) and then making some inference about this distribution.— Page 191, Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing, 1999.In their text on applied natural language processing, the authors and contributors to the popular NLTK Python library for NLP describe the field broadly as using computers to work with natural language data.We will take Natural Language Processing — or NLP for short –in a wide sense to cover any kind of computer manipulation of natural language. At one extreme, it could be as simple as counting word frequencies to compare different writing styles. At the other extreme, NLP involves “understanding” complete human utterances, at least to the extent of being able to give useful responses to them.— Page ix, Natural Language Processing with Python, 2009.Statistical NLP has turned another corner and is now strongly focused on the use of deep learning neural networks to both perform inference on specific tasks and for developing robust end-to-end systems.In one of the first textbooks dedicated to this emerging topic, Yoav Goldberg succinctly defines NLP as automatic methods that take natural language as input or produce natural language as output.Natural language processing (NLP) is a collective term referring to automatic computational processing of human languages. This includes both algorithms that take human-produced text as input, and algorithms that produce natural looking text as outputs.— Page xvii, Neural Network Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2017.

One of the aspects is What is natural language processing?. Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science—and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI—concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.NLP combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language—with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‘understand’ its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer’s intent and sentiment.NLP drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, respond to spoken commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidly—even in real time. There’s a good chance you’ve interacted with NLP in the form of voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences. But NLP also plays a growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline business operations, increase employee productivity, and simplify mission-critical business processes.
One of the aspects is NLP tasks. Human language is filled with ambiguities that make it incredibly difficult to write software that accurately determines the intended meaning of text or voice data. Homonyms, homophones, sarcasm, idioms, metaphors, grammar and usage exceptions, variations in sentence structure—these just a few of the irregularities of human language that take humans years to learn, but that programmers must teach natural language-driven applications to recognize and understand accurately from the start, if those applications are going to be useful.Several NLP tasks break down human text and voice data in ways that help the computer make sense of what it's ingesting. Some of these tasks include the following:See the blog post “NLP vs. NLU vs. NLG: the differences between three natural language processing concepts” for a deeper look into how these concepts relate.
One of the aspects is NLP tools and approaches. The Python programing language provides a wide range of tools and libraries for attacking specific NLP tasks. Many of these are found in the Natural Language Toolkit, or NLTK, an open source collection of libraries, programs, and education resources for building NLP programs.The NLTK includes libraries for many of the NLP tasks listed above, plus libraries for subtasks, such as sentence parsing, word segmentation, stemming and lemmatization (methods of trimming words down to their roots), and tokenization (for breaking phrases, sentences, paragraphs and passages into tokens that help the computer better understand the text). It also includes libraries for implementing capabilities such as semantic reasoning, the ability to reach logical conclusions based on facts extracted from text.The earliest NLP applications were hand-coded, rules-based systems that could perform certain NLP tasks, but couldn't easily scale to accommodate a seemingly endless stream of exceptions or the increasing volumes of text and voice data.Enter statistical NLP, which combines computer algorithms with machine learning and deep learning models to automatically extract, classify, and label elements of text and voice data and then assign a statistical likelihood to each possible meaning of those elements. Today, deep learning models and learning techniques based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) enable NLP systems that 'learn' as they work and extract ever more accurate meaning from huge volumes of raw, unstructured, and unlabeled text and voice data sets. For a deeper dive into the nuances between these technologies and their learning approaches, see “AI vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks: What’s the Difference?”
