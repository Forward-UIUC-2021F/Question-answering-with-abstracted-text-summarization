1. What is machine learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.But, using the classic algorithms of machine learning, text is considered as a sequence of keywords; instead, an approach based on semantic analysis mimics the human ability to understand the meaning of a text.Machine learning algorithms are often categorized as supervised or unsupervised.Machine learning enables analysis of massive quantities of data. While it generally delivers faster, more accurate results in order to identify profitable opportunities or dangerous risks, it may also require additional time and resources to train it properly. Combining machine learning with AI and cognitive technologies can make it even more effective in processing large volumes of information.Originally published March 2017, updated May 2020Practical AI is not easy.

2. Method of machine learning

K-Means is a great way to start with clustering. But you can also use other clustering techniques, such as hierarchical clustering, fuzzy c-means, and Gaussian mixture models. With dimensionality reduction, we reduce the number of variables in a data set without losing information. The goal is to reduce the complexity of the data set so that itâ€™s easier to understand and interpret. The most popular dimensionality reduction technique is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA is a linear transformation that transforms the data set into a new set of variables called principal components. The principal components are linear combinations of the original variables that are weighted by the amount of information they contain. The first principal component accounts for as much of the information as possible, the second accounts for as much of the remaining information as possible, and so on. The chart below shows the data set of buildings before and after PCA. The first principal component (PC1) accounts for most of the variation in the data, the second principal component (PC2) accounts for the remaining variation, and so on. The chart also shows the data set of buildings after applying PCA. The first two principal components account for most of the variation in the data set.

3. Applications of machine learning

Machine Learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. In other words, it is the study of computer algorithms that can learn from data. Machine Learning is a very broad field of study and has many practical applications. It is used in many areas of computer science, such as data mining, pattern recognition, statistical modeling, and artificial intelligence.
